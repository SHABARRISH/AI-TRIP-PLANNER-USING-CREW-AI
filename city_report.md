The information provided suggests that Chennai weather in 2025 is expected to be rainy, as indicated by alerts from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). However, the exact details of the weather forecast, such as temperature, wind speed, and rainfall, are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. To provide a more accurate answer, one would need to consult a reliable weather forecasting website or app that provides up-to-date information on Chennai's weather. Additionally, the provided text seems to be unrelated to the task at hand, as it mentions various events such as movies and weddings, but does not address the question about Chennai's weather in 2025. Therefore, my final answer is that I was unable to find any reliable information on Chennai's weather in 2025, and would recommend consulting a weather forecasting website or app for more accurate information.
